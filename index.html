		<p>These trifles are collected and republished chiefly with a view to their redemption from the many improvements to which they have been subjected while going at random "the rounds of the press."</p><blockquote> "I am naturally anxious that what I have written should circulate as I wrote it, if it circulate at all."</blockquote> <p>In defence of my own taste, nevertheless, it is incumbent upon me to say that I think nothing in this volume of much value to the public, or very creditable to myself. Events not to be controlled have prevented me from making, at any time, any serious effort in what, under happier curcumstances, would have been not a purpose, but a passion; and the passions should be held in reverence; they must not - they cannot at will be excited, with an eye to the paltry compensations, or the more paltry commendations of mankind.</p>

		<h3>Excerpt from</h3>

		<em><h2>The Raven</h2></em>
		<p class="raven">Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,<br>Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore—<br>While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,<br>As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.<br>“’Tis some visitor,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door—<br>Only this and nothing more.”</p>

    <p class="raven">Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December;<br>And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.<br>
    Eagerly I wished the morrow;—vainly I had sought to borrow<br>
    From my books surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the lost Lenore—<br>For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore—<br>Nameless here for evermore.</p>

    <p class="raven">And the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtain<br>Thrilled me—filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;<br>So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating<br>“’Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door—<br>Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;—<br>This it is and nothing more.”</p>

    <p class="raven">Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,<br>“Sir,” said I, “or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;<br>But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,<br>And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,<br>That I scarce was sure I heard you”—here I opened wide the door;—<br>Darkness there and nothing more.</p>

    <p class="raven">Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,<br>Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;<br>But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,<br>And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, “Lenore?”<br>This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, “Lenore!”—<br>Merely this and nothing more.</p>
